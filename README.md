    _ AN ABSTRACT OF THE LAWS OF NEW ENGLAND.This piece was printed in London in 1655 and, by William Aſpinwall the publiſher, allowed to have been the performance of Mr. Cotton. It ſhould rather be intitled An Abſtract of a Code or Syſtem of Laws prepared for the Commonwealth of the Maſſachuſets Bay; for although when they compiled their laws they made this abſtract their plan, in general, yet they departed from it in many inſtances, and in ſome which were very material. "Conſidering that theſe plantations had libertie to mould their civill order into that forme which they ſhould finde to be beſt for themſelves, and that here the churches and commonwealth are complanted together in holy covenant and fellowſhip with God in Chriſt Jeſus, he did at the requeſt of the general courte in the Baye drawe an abſtract of the lawes of judgment delivered from God by Moſes to the Commonwealth of Iſrael, ſo far forth as they are of moral, that is of perpetual and univerſal, equity among all nations, eſpecially ſuch as theſe plantations are; wherein he adviſed that Theocracie, i. e. God's government, might be eſtabliſhed as the beſt form of government wherein the people that chooſe civil rulers are God's people in covenant with him, that is members of churches and the men, choſen by them to be rulers, ſuch alſo, and the lawes of God and the miniſters of God are conſulted with by the governor, magiſtrates and people, in all hard caſes and in matters of the Lord, that is of religion, &c. and for the clearing of his judgment with the grounds thereof touching this matter I wiſh that ſome of his ſermons to the general court were printed."

    _ Anſwers of the Reverend Elders to certaine Queſtions propounded to them.The Elders were made umpires in a contention between the Governor and Aſſiſtants on the one part, and the Houſe of Deputies on the other. The patent, if the corporation had continued in England as was intended, admits of no difficulty in the conſtruction of it. Theſe doubts and queſtions ariſe meerly from changing a corporation in England into a common wealth in America.

    _ Proceedings of the Committee of the General Court appointed for the diſpatch of Agents to England.The colony at this time was divided upon the expediency of ſending agents to England. The Governor and Deputy Governor were againſt it, and though appointed to be of the committee declined acting. The agents themſelves ſeem to have been preſſed into the ſervice. They feared a long detention in England and were not ſure that they were intirely free from danger of reſtraint upon their liberty. Complaints had been preferred againſt the colony from all quarters. Mr. Bradſtreet had been a magiſtrate from the beginning. It was well known that the elders or clergy uſed to be conſulted and had great influence in every affair of moment, and Mr. Norton was of that order and of great note. Beſides, it was doubtful what would be the fate of the charter. If taken away they would not know where to obtain ſatisfaction for any extraordinary expence or trouble in England.The proceedings of this committee contribute to a juſt idea of the ſtate of the colony at this period.

It may well enough follow the ſentence againſt Gould.
